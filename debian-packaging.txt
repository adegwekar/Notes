- deb packages are simply archives with some meta data
- checkinstall: creates basic deb packages, but not an official package (no QA)
- dpkg-buildpackage: wrapper for dpkg utilities

Things needed for creating debian package:
* Package in tar format, usually .tar.gz or .bz2
* debian/changelog - changelog or revision history created using dch
* debian/control - controls what we create, what to create, which arch, who's responsible for package etc. Created by hand.
* debian/rules - what is needed to run to build the deb file. Use dh_make template. Typically a make file with rules for build, clean and install.
* debian/compat - compatibility level, e.g. 8

- dch: creates debian changelog
 (dch --create), (dch -a)
